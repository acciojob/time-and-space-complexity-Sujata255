	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. It's a crucial aspect of algorithm analysis as it helps understand how efficiently an algorithm performs, particularly as the size of the input data increases.</p>
	<p>N in big O notation usually means the size of the input, not the value passed in to the algorithm. <b> Space Complexity </b> of O(n) means that for each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated, i.e. the amount of memory needed to run the algorithm grows no faster than linearly at k*N.</p>
